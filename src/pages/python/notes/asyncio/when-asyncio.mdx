## What is Asynchronous

Asynchronous means that the action is requested but not necessarily performed at the time of the request. It might be performed later.

For example, making an asynchronous function call means that a request is issued to call the function. The caller will not wait around. It will continue executing. 

It is possible to check the status of the action or its result ata later time.

**Asynchronous Function Call:** Request that a function is called at some time and in some manner, allowing the caller to resume and perform other actions.

The caller does not caller how or when the request is handled. It only signals that it would like for it to be handled (execute the function).

Issuing an asynchronous function call often results in a handle, aka <ins>Future</ins>, that the caller can use to check the status of the request or get its result.

**Future:** A handle on an asynchronous function call allowing the status of the call to be checked and its results to be retrieved.

**Asynchronous Task:** Used to refer to the agregate of the asynchronous function call and the resulting future.

Asynchronous tasks are more elaborate than the asynchronous function call because they allow things such as the request to be cancelled and more.

**Asynchronous Programming:** The use of asynchronous techniques, such as issuing asynchronous tasks or function calls.

## Asynchronous IO
Asynchronous programming is primarily used with non-blocking IO such as reading/writing from socket connections with other processes or systems.

Non-blocking IO is a way of performing IO where reads and writes are done asynchronously. The called does not wait for the operation to complete before returning. 

**Asynchronous IO** is a shorthand that refers to the combination of asynchronous programming with non-blocking IO.

## Asynchronous Programming in Python
Broadly asynchronous programming in Python refers to making requests and not blocking to wait for them to complete.

The obvious way to implement this in Python is the <code class="inline">asyncio</code> module.

Python also offers threads and processes, both of which can be used to execute tasks asynchronously.

It also offers <ins>Executor</ins>-based thread pools and process pools with the <code class="inline">ThreadPoolExecutor</code> and <code class="inline">ProcessPoolExecutor</code> classes.

the <code class="inline">multiprocessing</code> module process the <code class="inline">ThreadPool</code> and <code class="inline">ProcessPool</code> classes.

In conclusion, the <code class="inline">asyncio</code> module is only one option for asyncronous processing in Python.
